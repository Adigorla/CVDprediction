# CVDprediction

- Build and test models in the sandbox jupyter notebook

- Build/compile stable models in model_x_x.py file. The x's represent version numbers.

- Paste stable and executable models developed sandbox into a new the model_x_x.py file, with appropriate performance metics with associated model commented in the file's head.

### TO DO:

- functionalize the loigisticalregression(), so that it is easier to run while varying prams
- make leaveone out function to test PE
- undertstand why normalization gives higher log loss
- hit log loss target of ~0.25
